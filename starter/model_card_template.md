## Intended Use
Intended use: The primary intended use is to determine somone's salary range based on personal information like age, marital status etc.

## Training Data
The training data from 80% of the publicly available data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income. 

## Evaluation Data
The evaluation data from 20% of the publicly available data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income. 

## Metrics
The model was evaluated using Precision, recall and F-beta scores.

## Ethical Considerations
The use of race and gender alludes to the fact that there are possibilities of work income disparities between race and/or gender groups. 

## Caveats and Recommendations
Further work can be done to split the salary range to a wider scale. 
Need to examine any data bias.
